## ðŸš° Plastic Reources

- [Synthetic Polymer Contamination in Bottled Water](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/chemistry/articles/10.3389/fchem.2018.00407/full)
  - an average of 10.4 microplastic particles >100 um in size per liter of bottled water processed were found
- [Priority Drinking Water Issues in Hawaii](https://open.clemson.edu/joe/vol50/iss2/71/)
  - (1) over 85% of survey respondents feel that their home drinking water is safe for consumption, (2) 84% obtain their drinking water from public water suppliers while 12.2% rely on bottled water
 - [Toxicity of Microplastics Explorer 2.0](https://sccwrp.shinyapps.io/human_mp_tox_shiny-/)
   - Data source of thousands of studies including: particulate only, human vs mouse, expsore route, endpoints, shape, dose metric etc)
   - Effect vs no effect based on dosage
  
 - [Environmental Microplastic and Nanoplastic: Exposure Routes and Effects on Coagulation and the Cardiovascular System](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11098554/)
 - [Non-Negligible Effects of UV Irradiation on Transformation and Environmental Risks of Microplastics in the Water Environment](https://www.mdpi.com/2039-4713/12/1/1)

 - [UVA-induced weathering of microplastics in seawater: surface property transformations and kinetics](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2025.1519668/full#supplementary-material)

 - [Probabilistic Estimation of Airborne Micro- and Nanoplastic Intake in Humans](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c09189)
   - This work shows that UVA irradiation in natural seawater causes substantial physicochemical aging of microplastics, modifying their morphology, surface chemistry, oxidation state, crystallinity, and additive leaching behavior
  
## ðŸŒ‹ Vog Resources
- Measured in PM 10
- [Acute health effects associated with exposure to volcanic air pollution (vog) from increased activity at Kilauea Volcano in 2008](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1080/15287394.2010.497440)
  - There were statistically significant positive associations between high vog exposure and visits for medically diagnosed cough, headache, acute pharyngitis, and acute airway problems.
