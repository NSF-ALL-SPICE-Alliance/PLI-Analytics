# 🌋 Toward an Integrated Particulate Load Metric for Human Exposure in Hawai‘i

> Modeling multi-source particulate burdens from volcanoes, wildfires, urban pollution, and plastics — across air, water, and behavioral pathways.

## 🧪 Project Overview

This project develops a prototype **Particulate Load Index (PLI)** to quantify cumulative human exposure to airborne and ingestible particulate matter in Hawai‘i. Using open-source geospatial, environmental, and demographic data, we model how **volcanic emissions (VOG), wildfire smoke, urban air pollution, and marine microplastics** contribute to health risk — across multiple routes: **inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact**.

Built for research, reproducibility, and public impact.

## 🔬 Research Objectives

- 📡 Ingest and harmonize multi-source environmental particulate data (VOG, PM2.5, microplastics)
- 🧍 Integrate demographic & behavioral exposure modifiers by age, occupation, housing, and mobility
- 🧠 Develop a machine-learning-based **Particulate Load Index (PLI)** to quantify cumulative burden
- 🗺️ Visualize spatial variations in PLI across Hawai‘i, enabling community and scientific insight
